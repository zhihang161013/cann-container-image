# What is CANN?

CANN (Compute Architecture for Neural Networks) is a heterogeneous computing architecture launched by Ascend for AI scenarios. It supports multiple AI frameworks and serves AI processors and programming. It plays a key role in connecting the upper and lower levels and is a key platform for improving the computing efficiency of Ascend AI processors. At the same time, it provides efficient and easy-to-use programming interfaces for diverse application scenarios, supporting users to quickly build AI applications and businesses based on the Ascend platform.

## Online Documentation

You can find the latest CANN documentation, including a programming guide, on the [project web page](https://www.hiascend.com/software/cann). This README file only contains basic setup instructions.

## Usage

Assuming your NPU device is mounted at `/dev/davinci1` and your NPU driver is installed at `/usr/local/Ascend`:

```docker
docker run \
    --name cann_container \
    --device /dev/davinci1 \
    --device /dev/davinci_manager \
    --device /dev/devmm_svm \
    --device /dev/hisi_hdc \
    -v /usr/local/dcmi:/usr/local/dcmi \
    -v /usr/local/bin/npu-smi:/usr/local/bin/npu-smi \
    -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64/ \
    -v /usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info:/usr/local/Ascend/driver/version.info \
    -v /etc/ascend_install.info:/etc/ascend_install.info \
    -it ascendai/cann:latest bash
```

## Build

Run the following command in the root directory:

```docker
docker build \
    -t ascendai/cann:latest \
    -f cann/tag/dockerfile
```
